## What interests me
This article introduces several trending game development models including the agile model. I find it interesting because the models mentioned have various distinct advantages and disadvantages, which are suitable to different project types and development situations. This makes them decent extensions to the agile development model. For instance, the waterfall model is a traditional model which constructs the underlying structure of many popular models, but it is not as effective now due to its lack of flexibility. The spiral model and the iterative model, on the other hand, provide flexibility, making it much easier to change plans in the middle of the development process. There is also the big bang model, which has even higher flexibility with very little time designated to planning. These variations of development models attract me in that they shine in different scenarios, giving me a pool of options to choose from when I develop games in the future.
